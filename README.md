# It's Complicated - a 21st Century Gender Picker

Welcome to the Its Complicated gem.  This gem is my attempt, likely flawed and at least partially incorrect, to build a 21st century gender picker:

* The world is no longer binary (it never was but many of us thought so) - there is more to the world than M, F
* People should be able to say who they are when a web site asks for gender (or not say at all; privacy matters)

## Technical Assumptions

This project assumes that you are storing a gender field in your database (generally in a user model but you may chose differently) that is a string.  This project gives a long list of possible gender options starting with: 

* Prefer not to say
* Female
* Male

and then descends into a long, long list of options.  My personal favorite is [Two-Spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-spirit) which is the Native American "third gender" role in their cultures.  Kudos to Lexi Taylor who knew this existed off the top of her head.

## Why Did I Write This Gem?

I hang on the Internet with a fairly diverse group of folks and I've been getting ready to launch a side project -- [ChangeMeNow](https://www.changemenow.io) -- a platform for successful personal change.  I was implementing user registration recently and while I wanted to capture gender (why - I don't really know - but every web site has it; advertising I guess).  

Knowing the folks that I do made me feel skeevy about a binary gender field.  And that made me go "Wait a minute, I can write this ...".

## Thank You's

This project could not have been built without a lot of help and support along the way:

* Shelley Johnson, my wife and best supporter ever
* Lexi Taylor - a good friend who gave me the first cut at the list and vetted the name of the project
* Lisa Meece - the chair person of [StarBase Indy](https://www.starbaseindy.org), the best science fiction and stem conference in Indianapolis (coming Thanksgiving weekend 2019)
* Jeana Jorgensen - an awesome professor at Butler and a reviewer of the list and someone who has strongly influenced my thinking in these areas

## Using This in Your Stuff?

I'd love to list a link to anyone who is using this.  Here are the sites that currently use this:

* [Change Me Now](https://www.changemenow.io) (currently experimental; email me for access if desired)

Email Scott Johnson - fuzzygroup a[t] gmail.com if you want your site listed here.
